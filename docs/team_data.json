I spent a good amount of time handling data collection, organizing files, and processing content to make sure everything stayed consistent and accessible for the team. It was a mix of creative thinking and hands-on work that taught me how important structure and detail are, especially when things scale. Looking back, I feel like I could’ve planned my file organization better early on—it would've saved a lot of time in the long run.
