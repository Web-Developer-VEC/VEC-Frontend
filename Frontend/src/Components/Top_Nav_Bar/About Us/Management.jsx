                As Founder - Chairman of the Velammal group of institutions, it is indeed a unique privilege for me to
                communicate to you utilizing our college website. Velammal Engineering College was established in the year
                1995-96 to impart quality education...

                "TO EDUCATE THE STUDENT COMMUNITY BOTH BY THEORY AND PRACTICE TO FIT IN WITH SOCIETY..."
              </strong>
              <p>          Every year, all our institutions maintain the set trend by achieving 100% pass results, and in the process
              secure overall State Ranks, Subject State Rank marks, etc. Our performance in academics is indeed
              praiseworthy, yet we do not tend to overlook co-curricular activities as well. Most of us are aware of the
              vital fact that of late, students are expected to fully equip themselves such that they are able to face
              the rigors of life at the global level. No doubt, the Trust spares no efforts, whatsoever, in this
              particular direction. We ensure that our students are well acquainted with personalities representing
              nearly all walks of life by utilizing their very presence as a motivating factor. In the past and at
              present too, the Trust honors students who excel in academics and sports with free education and suitable
              cash incentives as may be deemed necessary to encourage them to perform better. In a nutshell, I feel
              elated to state that all our students, on completion of their tenure in our group of institutions are
              molded into capable citizens of the morrow thereby, fulfilling the needs of their parents, society, and
              above all, represent their nation at the global level. It is only when they achieve this target do we sit
              back and fondly reminisce over our achievements and beyond doubt also be spurred to perform still better.
              Let me once again welcome you into our fold and hope you will also utilize this prized opportunity to its
              fullest extent to finally emerge as one of the brightest stars on the horizon of success. Wishing you all
              the best and hope you have a pleasant and memorable tenure in our midst.</p>
