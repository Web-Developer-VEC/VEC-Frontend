                <h2>Founder's Message</h2>
                <p>As Founder - Chairman of the Velammal group of institutions, it is indeed a unique privilege for me to communicate to you utilizing our college website.

                    Velammal Engineering College was established in the year 1995-96 to impart quality education. It is a self-financing non-minority institution, affiliated to Anna University and approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and also an ISO-certified institution.

                    In fact, our mission is very clearly reflected in our vision, viz<br></br>

                    <b>“TO EDUCATE THE STUDENT COMMUNITY BOTH BY THEORY AND PRACTICE TO FIT IN WITH SOCIETY AND TO CONQUER TOMORROW'S TECHNOLOGY AT GLOBAL LEVEL WITH HUMAN VALUES THROUGH OUR DEDICATED TEAM.”</b><br />

                    Every year, all our institutions maintain the set trend by achieving 100% pass results, and in the process secure overall State Ranks, Subject State Rank marks, etc. Our performance in academics is indeed praiseworthy, yet we do not tend to overlook co-curricular activities as well. Most of us are aware of the vital fact that of late, students are expected to fully equip themselves such that they are able to face the rigors of life at the global level. No doubt, the Trust spares no efforts, whatsoever, in this particular direction.
                    We ensure that our students are well acquainted with personalities representing nearly all walks of life by utilizing their very presence as a motivating factor. In the past and at present too the Trust honors students who excel in academics and sports with free education and suitable cash incentives as may be deemed necessary to encourage them to perform better.
                    In a nutshell, I feel elated to state that all our students, on completion of their tenure in our group of institutions are molded into capable citizens of the morrow thereby, fulfilling the needs of their parents, society, and above all, represent their nation at the global level. It is only when they achieve this target do we sit back and fondly reminisce over our achievements and beyond doubt also be spurred to perform still better.

                    Let me once again welcome you into our fold and hope you will also utilize this prized opportunity to its fullest extent to finally emerge as one of the brightest stars on the horizon of success. Wishing you all the best and hope you have a pleasant and memorable tenure in our midst
